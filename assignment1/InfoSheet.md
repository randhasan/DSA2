Does your program run without errors?: No ______________

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your
program run correctly?:

While most cases on Gradescope are passed, there are still a few text files that my code produces invalid outputs for.  The main root of the issue is when the program reaches a '-' sign.  For some reason, words that aren't words get placed on the board when there is a '-' in the same row and/or col.  Additionally, I couldn't figure out the reason why in one case, my CheckPuzzle() method didn't work even though I made sure it checked each case very thoroughly and believe it is functional.

Additional comments (including problems and extra credit):

I had some confusion about whether or not partial credit would be awarded for the project.  I wish I had asked sooner but I was under the impression that unless a 100% was received on GradeScope, I would be getting a 0.  I hope this is not the case as unfortunately the best I could do was a 64/75.  I've looked at this code long and hard and have accepted defeat.  I was hoping for an "aha!" moment but a girl can only dream.
