## Comparing the Tests:
- Overall, the modified implementation with codeword size going from 9 bits to 16 bits as explained above WITH dictionary reset proved to be the best variation of our program.  In LZW compression, patterns are added to the codebook as data is processed.  Unfortunately, as the codebook grows larger, it becomes less effective at encoding new patterns which ultimately makes the compressed data less efficient.  By resetting the codebook/dictionary, we are able to make a new one with the remaining data.  This enables the algorithm to adapt to new patterns in the data and encode them better.
- I think's it important to recognize, however, that the modified implementation with codeword size going from 9 bits to 16 bits as explained above WITHOUT dictionary reset still worked nearly as well most likely because resetting the dictionary can reduce compression efficiency on occasion.  Having to reset the codebook/dictionary means the compression algorithm has to start all over from scratch and rebuild based on they data.  This sometimes seemed to increase the size of the compressed data.
- Ultimately the predefined Unix compress program proved to work even better.  Even when it came to files that typically don't work so well when using LZW compression, the program didn't compress them while all of our variations expanded them.  I'm not totally sure why this is, but I can imagine the Unix program is well-optimized as its been used for so long.  It's reliability is likely why it's still used today.
- The original LZW program that used 12-bit codewords worked the worst most likely because of it's fixed codeword size vs. adaptive sizes.  The fixed codeword size might've caused instances where two different input sequences mapped to the same codeword as the number of unique codewords ran out.  Having adaptive sizes would enable the codeword size to be adjusted as needed which is why our implementations proved to work better.
- For more information of how the programs compare to each other, I've written an analysis of each test on each file we were given.  Below you will find original file sizes, compressed file sizes, and compression ratios for each scenario.

## Best and Worst Compression Ratios for Each Algorithm:
### The provided implementation that uses 12-bit codewords before any modifications:
- Best: 
> These four files compressed the best.  Text files are usually good candidates for LZW compresion because they usually have repeating patterns of data such as words and phrases.  By being able to identify said patterns, the data can be encoded more efficiently.  As for the .bmp file, there are only two colors used in the file.  These repeating color values can be compressed well using LZW.

- Worst: 
> These four files compressed the worst as they didn't even compress but instead, expanded.  I assume that because the first is a .jpg file, it was already compressed using lossy ceompression.  This would result is a few or even no repeating patterns left in the data to be compressed using LZW.  It most likely expanded because the algorithm had to add additional data to the file to store the codebook for expansion.  As for the .gif file, I assume it expanded because it seems to be very random with the placement of the blocks.  Since LZW relies on finding repeating patterns to successfully compress the data, there might not have been much of that in the file.  In terms of the .bmp file, the one below have several different colors which leads me to believe there is a lack in repeating patterns of data for LZW to compress effectively.  Finally, .exe files also usually lack repeating patterns of data that would make the LZW compression work the way we want it to.  They also might already be compressed so doing LZW on such data doesn't do much I'd assume.
